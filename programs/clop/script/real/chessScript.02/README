To use chess.tcl you must have a tcl interpreter on your system.

Also, at the top of chess.tcl you will need to make modfications which
are liberally commented.  Primarily this is where you set up the path
to the programs and the level.

IMPORTANT: The script accesses the opening book called autobook.txt to
provide variety based on the seed passed by CLOP - it must be in the
same directory CLOP is run from.

If you have any difficulties or issues contact dailey.don@gmail.com
